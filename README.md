# Share Business Logic With Native UI

## What I want to do is: Library Management System

This project has 3 goals:

1. Design UI by Kotlin Multiplatform, which must support the following platform and fit different
   screen size:
  - Android
  - Desktop
  - iOS (low priority)
  - Web (optional)
2. Design proper project architecture which is highly flexible, and can be maintained or expanded
   easily
3. Write test cases for every single method (include UI testing, if possible)
4. (Bonus) No Chinese in this project! Not even a single character! English only!
